terraform.tfvars has high priority. Values define in terraform.tfvars overide default variable define in generic variable file
terraform.tfvars is define as key and value

Local values enable you to pass  complex expresions and avoid code repetitions, moderate use , they ref modules, and other variables

#**************************
# Define Local Values in Terraform
#These local values will tag all resources created.

locals {
  owners = var.business_divsion                    # This ref variable "business_divsion" variable in the generic varible file
  environment = var.environment                     #This ref the "environment" variable in the generic varible file
  name = "${var.business_divsion}-${var.environment}"  # calling  both variable for name assignments eg HR-dev
  #name = "${local.owners}-${local.environment}"        # could also be define as in top level block
  common_tags = {
    owners = local.owners                               # This call  the var.business_divsion eg HR
    environment = local.environment                     # This call  the var.environment  eg dev
  }
} 

#*******************
vpc.auto.tfvars  # vpc variables can also be define in vpc.auto.tfvars , with the auto tag sepcify in the file name vpc."auto".tfvars , no need to 
to run terraform apply -var-file=vpc.tfvars at rune time
