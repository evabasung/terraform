terraform.tfvars has high priority. Values define in terraform.tfvars overide default variable define in generic variable file
terraform.tfvars is define as key and value

#These local values will tag all resources created.

locals {
  owners = var.business_divsion                    # This ref variable "business_divsion" variable in the generic varible file
  environment = var.environment                     #This ref the "environment" variable in the generic varible file
  name = "${var.business_divsion}-${var.environment}"  # calling  both variable for name assignments eg HR-dev
  #name = "${local.owners}-${local.environment}"        # could also be define as in top level block
  common_tags = {
    owners = local.owners                               # This call  the var.business_divsion eg HR
    environment = local.environment                     # This call  the var.environment  eg dev
